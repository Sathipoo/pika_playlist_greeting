# Clarity and Specificity:
# 	•	Be clear and specific about what you want in the image. Include details like objects, colors, setting, style, and mood.
# 	•	Example: “Generate an image of a serene beach at sunset with palm trees and a clear blue sky.”
# 	2.	Contextual Information:
# 	•	Provide context that helps the model understand the scene, such as the time of day, weather, or particular activities.
# 	•	Example: “A bustling city street at night, with neon lights and people walking.”
# 	3.	Incremental Prompts:
# 	•	Start with a broad prompt and then refine it with more specific details.
# 	•	Example: Start with “a park” and then add details like “a park in autumn with fallen leaves and a small pond.”
# 	4.	Use Examples:
# 	•	Provide visual references or descriptions of similar images to guide the generation.
# 	•	Example: “Create a fantasy landscape similar to the works of Studio Ghibli.”
# 	5.	Balanced Information:
# 	•	Give enough detail to convey your idea but avoid overwhelming the model with too much information.
# 	•	Example: “A minimalist living room with a modern design, white walls, a grey sofa, and a coffee table.”
# 	6.	Clear Intent:
# 	•	Clearly express the purpose or the main focus of the image.
# 	•	Example: “Illustrate a children’s book cover featuring a dragon and a knight.”
# 	7.	Adjust Tone and Style:
# 	•	Specify the desired style or tone of the image, such as realistic, cartoonish, abstract, etc.
# 	•	Example: “A watercolor painting of a sunflower field.”
# 	8.	Sequential Prompts:
# 	•	For complex scenes, break down the prompt into steps to guide the model through each part of the image.
# 	•	Example: “First, generate a mountain range in the background. Next, add a lake in the foreground. Finally, place a cabin near the lake.”
# 	9.	Avoiding Leading or Biased Descriptions:
# 	•	Frame your descriptions neutrally to avoid unintended biases.
# 	•	Example: Instead of “a rich businessman,” use “a man in a suit.”
# 	10.	Iterative Refinement:
# 	•	Refine the prompt based on the generated images, providing feedback to adjust details.
# 	•	Example: “Adjust the lighting to be softer” or “Change the color of the car to red.”
# 	11.	Creative Prompting:
# 	•	Use imaginative scenarios or storytelling elements to inspire unique and creative images.
# 	•	Example: “A futuristic cityscape with flying cars and towering skyscrapers.”
# 	12.	Understanding Limitations:
# 	•	Be aware of the model’s capabilities and limitations, and tailor your prompts accordingly.
# 	•	Example: Avoid overly complex scenes that the model may struggle to render accurately
